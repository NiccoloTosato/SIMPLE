# SIMPLE

Porting of old and ugly python code to cpp in order to add openMP + MPI support, irregular grid and better poisson solver.
Simple implementation of SIMPLE (Semi-Implicit Pressure Linked Equation) method to solve NS under some particular assumption and approximation.

Feature:
- Bussinesq approximation available.
- Dirichlet and Neuman b.c are available. 
- Temperature scalar field.
